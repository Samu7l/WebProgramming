        <h2>What impact does digital technology have on the environment?</h2>
        <p>
            Carbon footprint or the carbon content of a human activity is a measure of the greenhouse
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" target="_blank">gas emissions</a> of
            anthropogenic origin, i.e. that can be attributed to it. It depends on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_intensity" target="_blank">emissions factors</a> of the inputs
            linked to this activity, and in particular on the emission factors associated with
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions" target="_blank">CO2 emissions</a>.

            <h3>Why Do Websites Have a Carbon Footprint?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Every website has its own carbon footprint, i.e. the amount of greenhouse gas emissions generated by the process of creating and maintaining it. </li>
                <li> Your website's carbon footprint corresponds to the amount of CO2 emissions it created during its lifetime. </li>
                <li> The larger your website's carbon footprint, the greater the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What is the carbon footprint of a web page?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Browsing online and visiting websites requires electrical energy. This has a significant ecological impact. </li>
                <li> On average, a web page consulted produces 1.76 grams of CO2, and 7 grams for a Google search. </li>
                <li> The design and number of visits to a website largely influence the weight of its carbon emissions. </li>
            </ul>
